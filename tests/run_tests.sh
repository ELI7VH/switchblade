#
# Regression suite (tests/regress.c, tests/target_budget.py; details at the top of regress.c):
#   golden renders  every engine x preset, voice modes, FX sends, a 4-track mix: one hash
#                   each in tests/golden.txt. A change of the sound fails with the list of renders.
#   health          clipping, DC, peak level, voices free after the release, silence at the end.
#   CPU             instructions / sample per preset and mix (tests/cpu_baseline.txt, +25 %), ns printed;
#                   target: loop instructions of the render functions in the pi32v2 disassembly
#                   (tests/target_budget.txt, +10 %; exact, static).
#   voices          the budget of 8, steal fades, MONO / LEGATO / UNISON keep their note, the VOICE cap,
#                   no hanging notes on any MIDI / key routing.
# ENGINE MEMORY (tests/union_test.c, 1.5): engine switches on a part (every pair and A -> B -> A of the four machines),
#                   hashed against tests/union_golden.txt.
# UI renders (tests/ui_render.c): every screen in every palette from the real drawing code: the layout lint (no text
#                   off the screen, cut, hidden, overlapping or spilling out of its cell / card; only free text
#                   ellipsised), GREY gray, MONO neutral, the draw cost, the text audit (build/ui_new/text_audit.tsv);
#                   PNGs of GREY MONO GREEN PAPER NIGHT in build/ui_new (tests/ui_render.py), the findings in build/ui_new/report.txt;
#                   every frame of the rolling digits (lint, GREY, MONO), their filmstrips in build/ui_slot;
#                   the alignment: every text / icon / keycap meant to be centred, or on its neighbours' line, by its
#                   ink against its box (cells, chips, buttons, rows, knobs, the roll's strip, the keycaps' pills), every
#                   screen in FLAT and LINE and every palette, over every value it can show; 1 px off or more fails
#                   (build/ui_new/align.txt). MENU > LARGE: every screen again (FLAT, LINE, every palette) and the page / value
#                   sweep with the tall cards, the same lint and alignment; sheet_LARGE_GREY.png, sheet_LARGE_MONO.png.
# UI (tests/ui_test.c): the UI sources against stub display / buttons / knobs: sound loads keep the steps and
#                   the track's ARP / SCL / SLICER, the SAVE > PHRASES loader and its REPLACE? dialog, the
#                   one-step undo of both (SAVE held), REC on TRACKS / SEQ / ARP, STEP and ARP while recording,
#                   MIDI IN ROUT, saves refused while playing and the OVERWRITE? dialog, MUTE on TRACKS KNOB 1.
# Audio / persistence / editor: the real C paths against simulated DMA and NOR flash: bounded overload
#                   fades, shared-voice limits, deferred settings and retries, failed-save rollback, the autosave
#                   (1.2: when it writes, the power-on restore, damaged copies, a write cut short, wear over a session),
#                   malformed transfers, transport-stop timeouts, MIDI and UART recovery; the MENU settings over the
#                   editor (MENU_DESC / MENU_SET: every item, clamping, unknown ids, saving, USB SERIAL applied later).
# CHORD (tests/chord_test.c): the chord keys (src/chord.c): diatonic triads / sevenths of several scales and roots,
#                   the fixed shapes and voicings (at most 4 notes), names, MONO plays the root, a release ends
#                   exactly what its key / MIDI note started, recording, the ARP, MIDI IN.
# FUN10 (tests/fun10_test.c, 1.2): LFO 2 (SYNC one cycle per note value at several tempi and on the external clock, OFF bit
#                   for bit as before; TRIG NOTE / FREE; POL UNI 0..+1, the matrix's AMP), NUDGE (live recording keeps a
#                   note's time, QUANTIZE ON plays as before, OFF plays the nudges late and early once a pass, never twice
#                   with live notes, RATCH on its start, nudges 0 play the same either way, a tempo change of the external
#                   clock, SEQ > AUTOMATION's QUANTIZE and NUDGE rows, STEP steps held + PRESETS), 128 motion records, FUN10 round trip, FUN9 /
#                   user presets of 99 / 103 (Felucca FUN9 / FUN8 / FUN7 are refused in FOUR: project_test.c).
# RATCH (tests/ratchet_test.c): a step's ratchet (x1..x4): its parts in the sequencer (equal, gated, chords
#                   whole, one chance roll, swing, no slide or tie out, STOP), FUN8 round trip and older projects x1,
#                   user preset patterns, SEQ > AUTOMATION's RATCH rows and the roll drawing.
# STEP 1.5 (tests/step15_test.c, #178 #173): SEQ > STEP's KNOB 3 LEN on a note (clean TIEs written after it and taken
#                   back, stopping at the next note and at LEN, chords, undo, TIME elsewhere,
#                   the longer note played), a step's VEL as it plays (96 by default, ACC 127) and
#                   SEQ > AUTOMATION's VEL rows (SHOW / HIDE, KNOB 4, EDIT, undo).
# DETAIL 1.5.1 (tests/detail_test.c, #199): SEQ > DETAIL (STEP -> DETAIL -> AUTOMATION), KNOB 1..4 the cursor step's
#                   CHANCE RATCH NUDGE VEL walked with PRESETS (NO NOTE on a REST / empty step), the same values as
#                   AUTOMATION's rows (gone at their default; EDIT there deletes one), EDIT resets, undo per gesture, a chord's ratchet, playback, STEP's marks.
# SEQ 1.5.5 (tests/seq155_test.c, #209 #186 #85): CONDITIONS (1:2 .. 4:4 by each track's loops from PLAY / a SONG
#                   section, FILL / !FILL with GLO + E4, a NUDGE early step 1, no lock on a failed one, the chance draws
#                   as before), DETAIL's KNOB 1 past 100 % and AUTOMATION's COND rows, FUN10 round trip and what 1.5 /
#                   1.5.1 do with them; SEQ TOOLS' EUCLID (hits / steps / rotation, notes, OCT+ / OCT-,
#                   undo) and DOUBLE / HALF (ties, locks, the steps' own fields, 64 steps, undo).
# 1.5.5 (tests/ui155_test.c): PAN reads -100..+100 % (#199, the stored range as before); SEQ > AUTOMATION: KNOB 3 keeps
#                   its row in place (a step's records in the order they were added, #199); MENU > CONTROL > SELECT (#188):
#                   BPM by default, PAGE steps the family's pages (round, HOME MIXER CLOCK one round), GLO + SELECT the tempo;
#                   OCT- (1.5.6: #205's "OCT- held + a knob = default" taken out): the octave on the press as in 1.5.1, a
#                   knob with OCT- held an ordinary turn, the menu's OCT- back; SAVE > PROJECT ERASE (#199): KNOB 2, the dialog,
#                   refused playing / empty (tests/persistence_test.c: the flash side, a cut before the record keeps it);
#                   CLEAN INIT (#190): every engine's basic sound (no sends, INSERT, LFO / ENV / MOD amounts; neutral ENV),
#                   heard and ending; TOOLS' KNOB 2 on, EDIT + F5; one undo; INIT as before. OCT- next to
#                   EUCLID (OCT- cancels, OCT+ applies, no octave) and FILL (GLO + E4).
# 1.5.6 (tests/v156_test.c): HUMANIZE (#213): the matrix's VEL (a note-on's velocity, RAND per note, clamped 1..127) and
#                   TIME (a sequencer step late, 0..30 ms, at most 7/16 of the step, with NUDGE, a ratchet on time),
#                   appended after DEPTH; nothing changes without such a slot (RAND draws, mod_begin, timing); saved.
#                   LEDS (#212): INV LO / INV HI after INV (INV's lit LEDs at the mid level), saved as INV + a level byte.
#                   SELECT (#84): MODW (the track's mod wheel, CC1 out) and VEL (the keys' velocity) after BPM / PAGE.
# 1.6 (tests/v16_test.c): SEQ's piano roll follows the play position (#242, Discussion #238): a melodic pattern over 16 steps,
#                   the transport playing: the roll's bank is the playhead's (STEP and DETAIL), the cursor and the pattern
#                   untouched; not for 16 steps, stopped, AUTOMATION, HOME; held from a knob's move of the
#                   cursor, an edit of its step or step entry, free again after 3 s or one pass round; reset by stop / track.
# MOD (tests/mod_test.c): the modulation matrix: slots that do nothing are bit-identical, every source on each
#                   kind of destination, clamping, MIDI CC1 / CC11 / aftertouch routing, the cost of 4 active
#                   slots (at most +6 %, mod_test.c MOD_COST_MAX), demos in build/mod_demo/.
# INSERT (tests/insert_test.c, 1.5; #78 #177): the per-track INSERT (src/fx.c track_insert): TYPE OFF and MIX 0 bit for
#                   bit (POLY, SPREAD), each TYPE at its corners on 3 and 8 voices (no DC, bounded, MIX 50 % halfway
#                   to the wet), the MIX glide and TYPE changes, MIX / TYPE as automation and locks, FUN10 and user
#                   presets of 109 and 104, the pages' labels, the cost per type; demos in build/insert_demo/.
# SOUND 1.5 (tests/sound15_test.c; #104 #175): ANALOG's filter TYPE (LP bit for bit, every other engine ignores it, BP / HP
#                   responses around the cutoff, RES, bounded at the corners), ENV SYNC (OFF bit for bit, the note values
#                   on the knob, attack / decay / release times at 60 / 120 / 173 BPM and on the external clock), the cost;
#                   demos in build/sound15_demo/ (analog_bp, analog_hp, env_sync).
# FOUR (tests/four_test.c): the four-machine contract: ENGINES[] is OB-Z WAVE ACID DRIFT, their HOME knobs, ACID mono.
# OB-Z (tests/obx_test.c, tests/dspfft.h): the SEM-style filter morph on one voice (spectra through a plain FFT):
#                   MODE 0 is the low-pass of before the morph bit for bit, MODE 32 notches at the cutoff, 64 passes
#                   the highs, 96 is the band-pass, 120 the low-pass again and 127 the 4-pole; the crossfade between
#                   every pair of corners (16 / 48 / 80 / 108: each leg moves its band one way, none is inert), the
#                   corners meet without a step of their own (MODE 62 -> 63 against 63 -> 64), the crossfade and the
#                   4-pole bounded and adding no DC at RES 127; SLOP 0 is inert over different note-ons and SLOP 127
#                   spreads the voices within +-6 cents; DTN moves the second oscillator by its cents; dspfft.h's two
#                   refusals (an n it cannot transform, a band below 0 Hz).
# ACID (tests/acid_test.c, tests/acid_ref/, tests/acid_meas.h): the 303 voice (bass303.c, eng_acid.c) through the real voice path against
#                   the donor's own vectors (tests/acid_ref.sh regenerates them from fm1-x0x's bass303.c): the filter's impulse response on
#                   a 5 x 5 CUT / RES grid within 1 dB, the RES 127 resonance within 3 % of the donor's and tracking CUT, an accented step >= 3 dB
#                   louder and brighter, a 48 -> 60 slide (LEGATO and MONO: no retrigger, pitch rising across 50-70 ms, no dip), DECY 0 vs 127,
#                   the edit slots the vectors do not reach (E0 WAVE saw / square harmonics, E1 TUNE the measured pitch, E6 DRV level and
#                   harmonics, E7 SQL's RES / accent decay on an accented step only), the cost per voice (<= 3 x OB-Z, <= 1080 instructions /
#                   sample: macOS only, a loud SKIP elsewhere), amp() in [0, 32767], done() ends released and held notes.
# DRIFT (tests/drift_test.c, tests/drift_ref.cpp, tests/drift_ref_cfg.h): the Juno voice (eng_drift.c, dsp_va.c; the Ultramaster KR-106, GPL-3.0). Tier 1: the
#                   lifted ladder against the donor's own kr106::VCF on 40 cases (a 5 x 5 cutoff x resonance grid at OS 2, a spread at OS 1 (the shipped one) and OS 4, loud inputs),
#                   within 1e-4 of the peak; the half-band pair (unity gain, image rejection). Tier 2, through the real voice path: 24 dB/oct, the THD
#                   of DRV 0 / 127, RES 127 self-oscillating within 3 % of the cutoff, DRFT (0: two renders identical; 127: within +-8 cents), VAR (0: one
#                   cutoff; 127: spread), the MIX spectrum (sub / saw / pulse), P_FTYPE's HPF corners (and values above 3 = flat), a bounded sweep of the
#                   corners, the donor's DCO (inharmonic energy < -50 dB, the spectrum and the waveform against the ideal, PW, the auto PWM), KTR, the two DC
#                   blockers, the voice start (reset when finished, kept on a retrigger), and the cost: the DRIFT part inside its pin, the dearest legal
#                   four-track mix measured and printed (macOS only, a loud SKIP elsewhere).
# CHORUS (tests/chorus_test.c, tests/chorus_ref.cpp, tests/chorus_ref_cfg.h; Task 6.2): DRIFT's Juno chorus (dsp_chorus.c, the per-part stereo hook of fx.c; the
#                   Ultramaster KR-106's KR106Chorus.h + BBDFilter.h, GPL-3.0). Per mode I / II / I+II: the LFO rate (+-5 %) and the delay sweep (+-10 %) against the
#                   donor's and its constants, L / R in antiphase, the 1 kHz sidebands against the donor's, 15 renders against the donor's own kr106::Chorus (noise
#                   off), block-size independence, the fades; the int part block (mid / side, the guard clamp, an out-of-range mode is OFF); through the mix: CHOR OFF
#                   bit for bit as before, other engines ignore it, stereo, PAN, SPREAD, the worst case inside the mixer's integer limits; the parameter and its
#                   legacy value; the cost per part (macOS only, a loud SKIP elsewhere).
# WAVE (tests/void_tables_test.py, tests/void_test.c): the VOID WAVE plugin's voice (the WAVE engine, was VOID). Its wavetables against the plugin's
#                   frames recomputed with numpy (every keyframe and level band-limited, the crossfade within its limit;
#                   skipped without numpy); the engine: pitch, one oscillator (MIX / OSC2 hidden and inert), the clipper's clamp, the seven filter types bit for bit as before Task 4.5 (also with the slow loop forced), VOWEL (F1 / F2, level against LP24, bounded, cost), WARP (off bit for bit, aliasing, the old TBL2 values load as off), OB-Z / ACID / DRIFT playing VOWEL, the instrumented build (TYPE switched every block: no table read out of range; no int32 overflow at the corners), band-limited at C8, bounded and without DC at
#                   the corners (every table x TYPE, RES and DRV 127), the presets' levels, the cost at its voice cap
#                   against OB-Z RAVE; its filter against the plugin's own Filter.cpp (tools/void_ref.cpp, built from
#                   ../VoidWave or VOIDWAVE_DIR; skipped without it); demos in build/void_demo/.
# AUDITION (tests/audition.c, tools/audition_index.py, 7.1): build/host/audition build/audition renders every factory preset through the mix path to
#                   a 6 s WAV + summary.json and reports the ones outside the loudness / DC limits (exit 1; NOT part of this suite);
#                   tools/audition_index.py build/audition writes the rating page. Here: --selftest, the rules against synthetic signals.
# PERFORM (tests/perform_test.c): the FX hold layer (src/perform.c): 1/16 starts, stereo buffer effects, the
#                   too-long REPEAT, the SLICER interplay, silent layer keys, idle bit-identical, cost; build/perform_demo/;
#                   OCT UP / DN (the harmonizer): pitch, stereo, clicks, the shimmer bounded, cost; FLANGER / PHASER (1.2): no DC,
#                   bounded, the sweep in time with the tempo, clean release, stacked with REPEAT / LPF / HPF, cost; the key
#                   map (any effect or none on any key, a key remapped while held, FX LATCH); build/fx_demo/; 1.5.1: the
#                   delay's dotted TIME (lengths, the 1/4D clamp, the knob order), REV / ECHO THROW (the sends as at 127,
#                   the glide, ECHO's capped feedback bounded, the tails ringing out, assignable); build/throw_demo/.
# REVERB (tests/reverb_test.c): REVERB TYPE (src/fx.c): ROOM bit for bit as before, SPRING's decay against SIZE,
#                   its chirp (group delay rising with frequency), stability at the corners, level, a model change
#                   without a click, its cost against ROOM (+30 % at most); demos in build/fx_demo/. 1.2's HALL: SPRING
#                   bit for bit as before, decay against SIZE and DAMP, stability, exact silence after the tail (27
#                   settings and levels), no offset, level, stereo, echo density / ringing / flutter against ROOM, SPRING
#                   and COMB8 (8 combs + 4 allpasses, host only, for comparison), model changes both ways, cost; the
#                   listening set in build/reverb_demo/ (drums, pluck, piano: dry and each model at SIZE 40 / 90 / 127).
# INPUT (tests/input_test.c): the key / button debounce of hal/fm1_input.h against the TIMER5 scan and bouncing
#                   contacts: a press within 2 scans (<= 2.3 ms), one note per bouncy press, no early or hanging
#                   release, stray samples ignored, fast repeats, the encoders' detents; the LED scan: lit LEDs every
#                   frame, dim ones a short pulse (the second line write) every frame, each only on its own column;
#                   the breath (#119): dark .. ~60 % of lit (DIM LO ~30 %), smooth, no dark run over ~10 ms near its peak;
#                   the power-on sweep (1.1, hal/fm1_led_anim.h): its length, every LED every frame at its level, the
#                   head left to right with its tail, the buttons, the end on the idle glow, the tick as before after;
#                   the idle animation (1.2, MENU > ANIM IDLE): endless, every LED every frame, the light there and back,
#                   the buttons breathing, a key down ends it before its next frame.
# CLICK (tests/click_test.c, 1.1): the metronome (src/click.c) and the count-in (src/seq.c) through audio.c: each beat at
#                   the first sample of its block, with a 1/16 track's steps 1 5 9 13 (internal and external clock, DIV 1/8
#                   and SWING too), the accent, the frequencies, length, LEVEL, MASTER, OFF / REC / ON, USB audio bit for bit
#                   without it; COUNT-IN 1 / 2 BARS (step 1 exactly N bars after PLAY, STOP cancels, PLAY again nothing,
#                   never with an external clock), notes in its last eighth onto step 1; build/click_demo/.
# USB audio (tests/uac_test.c): the UAC1 descriptors as a host parses them (with and without CDC; 44100 and
#                   48000 Hz), the ring and packetiser: 44.1 frames per packet, every frame in order (bit for bit),
#                   underrun / overrun, restart; SET_CUR; the 44.1 -> 48 kHz resampler (every frame against a
#                   double-precision one, response, SNR, cost); the stream at 48 kHz (47..49 frames per packet,
#                   fast and slow I2S clocks, switching rates mid-stream).
# ROBUST (tests/robust_test.c): damaged or crafted stored data and editor requests: engine numbers past the last refused, a retained older
#                   RAM project bounded, user preset patterns inside their fields, malformed requests never stop PLAY.
# Sanitizers (ASan + UBSan, when the compiler has them; SANITIZE=0 skips): the stored-data and protocol tests again
#                   (loader, M-UPGRADE entry, editor, projects, backup, ROBUST) and two short fuzz runs with fixed
#                   seeds: tests/fuzz_ed.c (editor SysEx and raw USB-MIDI packets), tests/fuzz_proj.c (mutated project
#                   stores -> import -> restore -> render). Longer runs: build/host/asan/fuzz_ed 300000 7 (iterations, seed), the same for the others.
#                   UBSan leaves out the DSP's intended wraps (signed overflow, shifts) and the XIP rebase of a user zone's
#                   offset (bounds, object-size, pointer-overflow: correct on the device's flat flash, not in C's model).
# Change baseline entries only for reviewed, intentional differences in sound or cost;
# retain every unaffected golden / CPU / target entry. VERBOSE=1: every render.

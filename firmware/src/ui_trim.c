/* ui_trim.c: the machines' trim (Switch Blade: the machine look is the one colour scheme). A few rectangles per machine, drawn on the
 * strips of the header, EDIT and the footer (HOME's rack units carry their own looks, ui_big.c), to evoke the panel the machine is modelled on (assets/refs/): the OB-6's blue
 * pinstripes and wood cheeks (OB-Z), the Juno-106's red and blue section bands (DRIFT), the TB-303's dark step section
 * with its red LEDs (ACID), the VOID WAVE plugin's amber glow rule (WAVE). No bitmaps: data, drawn with cv_rect /
 * lcd_fill, on the free rows and columns only (docs/plans/2026-10-19-switch-blade-ui.md, "UI.3").
 *
 * Where there is room: the header's ink lies in rows 4 .. 19, so rows 0 .. 3 and 20 .. 23 are free; the cards, the tabs
 * and the sound panel sit 3 px in from the screen's edges (x 0 .. 2 and 237 .. 239) and 1 px apart vertically (the BG
 * rows between the strips: y 24, 67 / 68, 147 / 148, 211 on HOME; 24, 117 / 118, 211 on EDIT); the footer's steps lie in
 * rows 7 .. 22 of its 28 (y 219 .. 234), so its rows 0 .. 5 and 24 .. 27 are free. A trim rectangle never lies under a
 * text, an icon or a card: the host lint (tests/ui_render.c GFX_HOOK_TRIM) checks every canvas.
 *
 * Only a machine palette (MACHINE mode, ux.trim) has a trim; a fixed palette and CUSTOM look as they always did, and so
 * does STYLE LINE (the dividers are the seams). The splash is not themed. A strip draws the trim right after cv_begin:
 * a canvas of a strip is the whole of what it shows, so the trim is part of its background and is redrawn with it */
